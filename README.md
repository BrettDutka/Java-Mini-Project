# Java-Mini-Project
Developed Java Programs for image processing and weather forecasting, using tools to manage the image operations and get the correct weather data.


Developed a Java-based application capable of performing image processing and weather forecasting tasks. This project involved creating many tools that could handle image operations and analyzing weather data. 

Image Processing: Used classes and methods to handle the image operations for example loading, saving, and modifying the PPM images. Using object-oriented programming to design efficient image manipulation features. 

Weather Forecasting: Developed a system to process and interpret weather data which would provide accurate forecasts based on location using coordinates. This involved reading and analyzing datasets to output user-friendly weather predictions.
